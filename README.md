# Plus-Minus-Algorihm


Plus-Minus Algorithm (PMA) is a data-encryption algorithm that takes an input of a message, or data needing to be protected with encryption, and string of data to act as the key to encrypt AND decrypt the inputed message. PMA's process uses SHA512 Hashing in-order to verify a successful decryption attempt.


White paper for algorithm coming soon.
